# TriMEph
## Basic description
TriMEph is an object-oriented software designed to compute and visualize temperature trends of the Mössbauer factor in materials. It uses mean square displacement of atoms evaluated from phonon modes as input - the input files are output files of the PHONOPY software, e.g. the phonopy.yaml file. The Mössbauer effect plays a crucial role in our atomic-scale probing and understanding of materials. It is based on interactions of gamma rays with atomic nuclei and the Mössbauer factor is a key parameter in describing this interaction.
